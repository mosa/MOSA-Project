	/// Represents a compilation stage during compilation of the JIT or AOT compilers.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Compilation stages are typically realized as individual components acting on fragments
	/// of a .NET IL binary. The JIT compiler uses a defined subset of the AOT compilation stages
	/// in order to provide fast code generation. Both compilers share a single compilation model
	/// consisting of a set of individual stages forming a compilation pipeline. The pipeline
	/// model allows for flexible configuration of the capabilities of either compiler. Individual
	/// stages may represent IL decoding, machine code generation, register allocation, emitting
	/// machine code and finally storing it in a binary. This provides for a highly modular and
	/// extensible compilation model.
	/// <para />
	/// In addition to the IMethodCompilerStage interface other compilation stage specific interfaces
	/// must be implemented.
	/// </remarks>
