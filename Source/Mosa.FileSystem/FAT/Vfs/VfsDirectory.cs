	/// <remarks>
	/// This method is central to the entire VFS. It allows for interaction with file system entries in a way not possible

	/// for a classic file (stream of bytes) the result of this method call would be a System.IO.Stream. For a device the result would
	/// be the driver object, for a directory it would be a System.IO.DirectoryInfo object, for kernel objects the respective object such
	/// as System.Threading.EventWaitHandle, System.Threading.Mutex, System.Threading.Thread, System.Diagnostics.Process etc. Note: The object
	/// retrieved can be closed by the respective methods on the returned object. There's no close functionality on the IVfsNode itself.
