BareMetal Experiment
####################

**BareMetal** is an experimental Operating System with the design goal of utlitizing a single source code tree that supports multiple platforms (x86, x64, Arm) for all the high-level functions of the kernel.

Platform specific low-level functions are incorporated using ``method plugs``, which act similar to a method override.

.. warning:: BareMetal is experimental and incomplete.

The demo can be started by executing the following script: ``Demos\DEVELOPMENT-Run-Mosa.BareMetal.HelloWorld.x86.bat``.
