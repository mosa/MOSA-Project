BareMetal Experiment
####################

**BareMetal** is an experimental Operating System with the design goal of utlitizing a single source code tree that supports multiple platforms (x86, x64, ARM) for all the high-level functions of the kernel.

Platform specific low-level functions are incorporated using ``method plugs``, which act similar to a method override.

.. warning:: BareMetal is experimental and incomplete.

A BareMetal demo can be launched by executing a BareMetal scripts inside the Demos folder.
